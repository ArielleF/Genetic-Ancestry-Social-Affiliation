# Genetic ancestry predicts male-female affiliation in a natural baboon hybrid zone (Fogel et al. 2021, *Animal Behaviour*)

### This repository includes R code for recreating the analyses and figures from Fogel et al. 2021, *Animal Behaviour* (doi XXX here). These scripts include:
1. ***Calculated_variables***: scripts for calculating variables (e.g., the assortative genetic ancestry index, heterozygosity, relatedness, female age transformed).
2. ***Models***: scripts for running the multivariate logistic regression models predicting grooming and proximity behaviors.
3. ***Permutations***: scripts for permutation tests to assess statistical significance in the multivariate logistic regression models.
4. ***Figures***: scripts for making main text and supplementary figures.

Data from this paper and used by these scripts can be downloaded from the Duke Data Repository: XXX link. 

For script-related questions, please email Arielle Fogel at <afogel29@gmail.com>.

Thank you for your interest in our work!
