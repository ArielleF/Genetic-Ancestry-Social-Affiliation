# Genetic ancestry predicts male-female affiliation in a natural baboon hybrid zone (Fogel et al. 2021, *Animal Behaviour*)

### This repository includes R code for recreating the analyses and figures from Fogel et al. 2021, *Animal Behaviour* (doi XXX here). These scripts include:
1. ***Calculated_variables***: scripts for calculating variables (e.g., the assortative genetic ancestry index, heterozygosity, relatedness, female age transformed, observer effort).
2. ***Models***: scripts for running the multivariate logistic regression models predicting grooming and proximity behaviors.
3. ***Permutations***: scripts for permutation tests to assess statistical significance in the the multivariate logistic regression models.
4. ***Figures***: scripts for making main text and supplementary figures.

### Data from this paper and used by these scripts can be downloaded from the Duke Data Reposity here: 

Include simulation coding?
