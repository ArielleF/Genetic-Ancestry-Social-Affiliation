#![Amboseli Baboons](/assets/images/philly-magic-gardens.jpg "Philadelphia's Magic Gardens")

A male and female baboon in the Amboseli basin of southern Kenyna, maintaining close spatial proximity, an affiliative behavior important to establishing, maintaining, and strengthening social bonds in non-human primates.

# Genetic ancestry predicts male-female affiliation in a natural baboon hybrid zone (Fogel et al. 2021, *Animal Behaviour*)

## This repository includes code. These scripts include:
1. Scripts for calculating variables (e.g., the assortative genetic ancestry index, heterozygosity, relatedness, female age transformed, observer effort).
2. Scripts for running the multivariate logistic regression models predicting grooming and proximity behaviors.
3. Scripts for permutation tests to assess statistical significance in the the multivariate logistic regression models.
4. Scripts for making main text figures.

Include simulation coding?
